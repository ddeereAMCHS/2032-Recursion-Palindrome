# Palindrome

### Part 1

- Create a program called `Palindrome.java`
- Create a static method called isPalindrome that returns true if the String passed to it is a palindrome
  - A palindrome is a String that is the same forwards and backwards
  - ex. racecar
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user for a word
  - Call the isPalindrome method with that word as a parameter
  - Print the result

### Part 2

- Add another method called isPalindromeIgnoreSpaces that returns true if the String passed to it is a palindrome, ignoring whitespace
- Ex. `taco cat` would return true
